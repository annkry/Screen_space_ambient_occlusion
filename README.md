# SSAO implementation

## Authors

The authors of the SSAO implementation include Xinpei Han, Olesia Shchukina, and Anna Krysta.

## Setting input parameters

In the `main.py` file, the width and height of the output image (lines 8-9) can be set. Also, in the same file, the input model to be rendered could be specified (line 32).

## Compilation and execution

In order to run the program, simply run the `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` command.

## Add your files

In the `models` directory, new models with the `ply` extension (ASCII) can be added, in addition to the existing ones. Please ensure that each model contains both positions and normals.
